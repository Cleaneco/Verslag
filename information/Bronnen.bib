  abstract={Increasing wind power generation quantity in power systems needs obviously reliable operation. Therefore, accurate condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are almost mandatory. This paper aims to report recent works on condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for wind turbine generators. Wind turbines are subjected to different sort of failures, thus before stating condition monitoring and fault diagnosis methods it is necessary to identify what kind of failures can be found in the real world. As a result, the gearbox is one of the most critical components of the wind turbine in which failures could stop generation for a long time. Recently, several condition monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques have been introduced in order to minimize downtime and maintenance cost while increasing energy availability and life time service of the wind farms. Vibration sensors have been used for long time in wind turbine condition monitoring systems to collect data of the generator health. Actually, using such sensors is expensive, difficult to install and sometimes impossible to be implemented in already installed wind turbines. Therefore, researchers have been focused on using electrical signature analysis from sensors in order to detect wind turbines faults and generator health in a cheap, easy to install and accessible way.},

  abstract={We examine optimal repair strategies for wind turbines operated under stochastic weather conditions. In-situ sensors installed at wind turbines produce useful information about the physical conditions of the system, allowing wind farm operators to make informed decisions. Based on the information from sensors, our research objective is to derive an optimal preventive maintenance policy that minimizes the expected average cost over an infinite horizon. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a partially observed Markov decision process. Several critical factors, such as weather conditions, lengthy lead times, and production losses, which are unique to wind farm operations, are considered. We derive a set of closed-form expressions for the optimal policy, and show that it belongs to the class of monotonic four-region policies. Under special conditions, the optimal policy also belongs to the class of monotonic three-region policies. The structural results of the optimal policy reflect the practical implications of the turbine deterioration process.},

  abstract={Cost-effective wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring assumes more importance as turbine sizes increase and they are placed in more remote locations, for example, offshore. Conventional condition monitoring techniques, such as vibration, lubrication oil, and generator current signal analysis, require the deployment of a variety of sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. This paper describes a WT condition monitoring technique that uses the generator output power and rotational speed to derive a fault detection signal. The detection algorithm uses a continuous-wavelet-transform-based adaptive filter to track the energy in the prescribed time-varying fault-related frequency bands in the power signal. The central frequency of the filter is controlled by the generator speed, and the filter bandwidth is adapted to the speed fluctuation. Using this technique, fault features can be extracted, with low calculation times, from direct- or indirect-drive fixed- or variable-speed WTs. The proposed technique has been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test rig. A synchronous or induction generator was successively installed on the test rig, and both mechanical and electrical fault like perturbations were successfully detected when applied to the test rig.},

  abstract={To achieve higher efficiency and reduce the wind energy cost, the size of wind turbines is getting bigger and offshore wind is getting more attraction. Therefore, the Operation & Maintenance of a single wind turbine and a large-scale wind farm are becoming more important. This paper presents the implementation of digital twin-assisted condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for wind turbines. Based on a 5-dimension modeling approach, we design and implement a digital twin for a 2 MW class double-fed induction generator-based wind turbine system. Then, we suggest an algorithm based on the digital twin framework to virtually monitor wind turbine conditions and form an initial fault detection algorithm. The digital twin shows high accuracy and the digital twin-based diagnosis algorithm shows a high performance.},

  abstract={The paper proposes a wind power consumption strategy with flexible resource coordination scheduling based on digital twin for the flexible resource aggregation and efficient consumption caused by the high proportion of new energy sources connected to the grid under low-carbon goals. Digital twin technology is used to achieve ultra-short-term forecasting of new energy generation output and load electricity consumption in response to the time-varying nature of environmental factors. Considering the energy storage characteristics and adjustable characteristics of electric vehicles(EVs), the load characteristics can be improved by optimizing the EV charging and discharging power and attributing EVs to different aggregators according to the location of charging posts. The corresponding objective functions are established in order to satisfy the demands of both grid side and users. Finally, The experimental results verify that the proposed strategy can achieve high accuracy prediction of wind turbines, reduce the level of wind power abandonment, and effectively reduce the load fluctuation.},

  abstract={Power distribution networks represent a dynamic and complex challenge with regard to the issues of maintenance and providing a reliable, high quality supply. Utilities historically used regular off-line testing to inform themselves of the health of their assets. This method is reasonably effective for this purpose but does have certain drawbacks associated with it; customer supply can be interrupted during the testing process and the cable sample is not tested under normal working conditions. The modern approach for understanding the health of medium voltage (MV) distribution systems is to continuously monitor the assets whilst on-line. The analysis of the captured data is then used to inform decisions regarding asset replacement and maintenance strategies. Partial discharge (PD) activity is widely recognized as a symptom linked to the degradation of high voltage plant. EDF Energy Networks sponsored research is being undertaken to investigate the evolution of PD activity within paper insulated lead covered (PILC) cables containing known defects. An experiment has been designed to stress cable sections in a such a manner that is representative of the conditions met by on-line circuits. A cable section containing a defect that is known to lead to the failure of in-service cables has been PD tested over a range of operational temperatures. The experiment utilizes three-phase energization and thermal cycling to replicate the daily load pattern experienced by circuits in the field.},

  abstract={The offshore wind power is increasingly developed, it is essential to study the design technology of the offshore wind turbine foundation, which is crucial to reduce the construction cost of the offshore wind farm. In the design of marine pile foundations, the evaluation of wave-induced seabed stability is quite significant. Based on the mechanical properties of seabed, this article firstly puts forward one simplified mechanical model, and then derives the soil displacement distribution of the two-dimensional seabed under wave action. Combining this simplified model of seabed instability with the dynamic p-y curve method, the offshore wind turbine monopole is modeled in ANSYS, and the effect of seabed instability on the bearing capability of the marine pile foundation is evaluated, some conclusions are obtained, which could be referenced in the design and analysis of the offshore wind turbine foundations.},
